# Git Setup
This is the step-by-step instructions of how to set up Git for the command line.

This setup will be done for the Windows OS, but the steps should remain relatively the same for other operating systems.

Using commands on the terminal makes me feel really cool and smart, but it is not as user-friendly as the GUI for Git through Github Desktop. If you feel up to it, follow along and use the command line, otherwise, there's no harm is using the tools someone else built to make our lives as developers easier.
## Installation
**Note**: This guide is for installing the git for command-line usage.
1. Navigate to this [link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and click on your operating system followed by the download button
